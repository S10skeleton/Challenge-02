The setup includes two alligator leads connecting the battery terminals to the voltage meter board. A buck converter reduces the 12-volt feed to 5 volts for the ESP32 module. This voltage meter sends the current vehicle voltage via the ESP32 WiFi board to a custom app on my phone and smart home server, integrated with the Home Assistant OS. By implementing a sleep and awake function, I reduced the parasitic draw from the device to 26.85 Î¼W, ensuring minimal battery drain.",

For audio, I incorporated two 12-inch subwoofers connected to a car amplifier, delivering powerful bass for movies and immersive vibrations for video games. To enhance the overall look, I wrapped the structure in carbon fiber and brushed steel vinyl wrap, while the tops are covered in neoprene for a sleek, professional finish. This setup not only allows me to work efficiently at my desk but also provides an exceptional entertainment experience for watching movies and gaming.",
